## INTRODUCTION
As an avid dog lover, I am happy to dive into the dog world. Using data to explore different dog breeds' characteristics  
This project will be divided into three sections

## SECTION ONE - DATA CLEANING AND MODULE CREATION
This section is a walk through of how I integrated and pulled the dataset, cleaned the data and create a module that will enable you search for dog breeds.

Cleaning the dataset is found [here (Dog_breeds.ipynb)](https://github.com/iamcbn/Dog-Breeds/blob/main/Dog%20breeds.ipynb)  
Also, you can download the module by clicking [here!](https://github.com/iamcbn/Dog-Breeds/blob/main/dog_breed.py)  

There is no harm in asking for help. How can I make the module globally accessible without having to download the module file in your directory?

## SECTION TWO - DATA ANALYSIS (INFOGRAPHICS)
I am still working on this!
